# 🔌 ESP32 Code Upload Guide

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: You Need to Upload New Code to ESP32**

Your ESP32 is currently running **OLD CODE** (notice it shows "ESP32_9302" instead of the new device ID). You need to upload the new code to fix this.

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

1. **Arduino IDE** installed on your computer
2. **ESP32 board support** added to Arduino IDE
3. **ArduinoJson library** installed
4. **ESP32 connected** to your computer via USB

## 🔧 **Step 1: Install ESP32 Board Support**

1. **Open Arduino IDE**
2. **Go to File → Preferences**
3. **Add this URL** to "Additional Board Manager URLs":
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
4. **Click OK**
5. **Go to Tools → Board → Boards Manager**
6. **Search for "ESP32"**
7. **Install "ESP32 by Espressif Systems"**

## 📚 **Step 2: Install Required Libraries**

1. **Go to Tools → Manage Libraries**
2. **Search and install these libraries**:
   - `ArduinoJson` by Benoit Blanchon
   - `WiFi` (usually comes with ESP32 board)
   - `HTTPClient` (usually comes with ESP32 board)
   - `DNSServer` (usually comes with ESP32 board)

## 🔌 **Step 3: Upload New Code**

1. **Open the file**: `esp32_attendance/esp32_fixed.ino`
2. **Select Board**: Tools → Board → ESP32 Arduino → ESP32 Dev Module
3. **Select Port**: Tools → Port → Your ESP32 COM port (e.g., COM3, COM4)
4. **Click Upload** button (→) or press Ctrl+U

## 📡 **Step 4: Verify Upload**

1. **After upload completes**, open Serial Monitor
2. **Set baud rate to 115200**
3. **You should see**:
   ```
   🚀 ESP32 Attendance System Starting...
   🌉 Setting up ESP32 Access Point...
   📡 ESP32 IP: 192.168.4.1
   ✅ Access Point Ready!
   📶 Network: ESP32_Attendance
   🌐 IP Address: 192.168.4.1
   💻 Django Server: http://10.141.126.27:8000
   🔓 No password required
   ```

## 🌐 **Step 5: Test Network Creation**

1. **On your phone/computer**, go to WiFi settings
2. **Look for network**: `ESP32_Attendance`
3. **Connect to it** (no password)
4. **You should get IP** like `192.168.4.x`

## 🧪 **Step 6: Test Django Access**

1. **Make sure Django is running** on `0.0.0.0:8000`
2. **While connected to ESP32 WiFi**, open browser
3. **Go to**: `http://10.141.126.27:8000/admin-panel/`
4. **You should see** Django login page

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Upload Fails?**
- Check USB connection
- Hold ESP32 reset button during upload
- Try different USB cable
- Check COM port selection

### **No WiFi Network?**
- Check Serial Monitor for errors
- Verify code uploaded successfully
- Try resetting ESP32

### **Can't Connect to WiFi?**
- Make sure ESP32 is powered
- Check network name: `ESP32_Attendance`
- Try forgetting and reconnecting

### **Django Not Accessible?**
- Ensure Django runs on `0.0.0.0:8000`
- Check firewall settings
- Verify you're on ESP32 WiFi network

## 📱 **Expected Behavior After Upload**

### **ESP32 Serial Monitor**
```
🚀 ESP32 Attendance System Starting...
🌉 Setting up ESP32 Access Point...
📡 ESP32 IP: 192.168.4.1
✅ Access Point Ready!
📶 Network: ESP32_Attendance
🌐 IP Address: 192.168.4.1
💻 Django Server: http://10.141.126.27:8000
🔓 No password required
```

### **When Students Connect**
```
🔌 New client connected
📱 Student device connected - recording attendance
✅ New student connected: ESP32_1234 (192.168.4.3)
📤 Attendance data sent to Django
💓 Sending heartbeat to Django...
✅ Heartbeat sent successfully
```

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

✅ **ESP32 creates WiFi network**: `ESP32_Attendance`  
✅ **Students can connect** without password  
✅ **ESP32 shows new device IDs** (not old ones like "ESP32_9302")  
✅ **Students can access Django** at `http://10.141.126.27:8000`  
✅ **ESP32 sends data to Django** successfully  

## 🚀 **Ready to Upload?**

**Your ESP32 needs the new code to work properly!** Follow the steps above to upload `esp32_fixed.ino` to your ESP32 device.

**After upload, you'll have a working ESP32 access point system! 🎉**
